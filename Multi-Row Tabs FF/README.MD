Updated by me to work on version 69

Stolen from https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme

Put files in you FF profile "Root Directory" /chrome   You might have to create the /chrome part of the folder

To find you FF profile "Root Directory" visit about:profiles

This does not modify theme colors, it just adds multi-row tabs
